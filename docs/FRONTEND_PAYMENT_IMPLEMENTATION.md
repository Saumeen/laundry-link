# Frontend Payment Implementation

## Overview

The frontend implementation has been updated to properly handle the direct payment flow with redirect support for 3D Secure authentication and other payment gateway interactions.

## Components Updated

### 1. CardPaymentForm.tsx

**New Features:**
- Added `onRedirectRequired` callback prop
- Handles `redirect_required` status from API
- Stores payment details in localStorage before redirect
- Calls redirect handler when payment gateway redirect is needed

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
interface CardPaymentFormProps {
  // ... existing props
  onRedirectRequired?: (redirectUrl: string, paymentRecord: any) => void;
}

// In processPayment function:
if (data.status === 'redirect_required' && data.redirectUrl) {
  // Store payment details for when user returns
  localStorage.setItem('pendingDirectPayment', JSON.stringify({
    paymentRecord: data.paymentRecord,
    order: data.order,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    orderId,
    orderNumber,
    amount
  }));
  
  // Call the redirect handler
  onRedirectRequired?.(data.redirectUrl, data.paymentRecord);
}
```

### 2. DirectPaymentModal.tsx

**New Features:**
- Added `handleCardPaymentRedirect` function
- Stores additional payment context in localStorage
- Redirects user to payment gateway
- Shows appropriate toast message

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
const handleCardPaymentRedirect = (redirectUrl: string, paymentRecord: any) => {
  showToast('Redirecting to payment gateway for authentication...', 'info');
  
  // Store additional payment context
  if (customer?.id) {
    localStorage.setItem(`directPaymentInProgress_${customer.id}`, JSON.stringify({
      orderId,
      orderNumber,
      amount,
      paymentRecord,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    }));
  }
  
  // Redirect to payment gateway
  window.location.href = redirectUrl;
};
```

## Payment Flow

### 1. Payment Initiation
1. User fills in card details in `TapCardForm`
2. Card is tokenized via Tap SDK
3. Token is sent to `/api/customer/direct-payment`

### 2. API Response Handling
The frontend now handles three response scenarios:

#### A. Immediate Success
```typescript
if (data.success && !data.status) {
  onSuccess(); // Payment completed immediately
}
```

#### B. Redirect Required
```typescript
if (data.status === 'redirect_required' && data.redirectUrl) {
  // Store payment details
  localStorage.setItem('pendingDirectPayment', JSON.stringify({...}));
  
  // Redirect to payment gateway
  onRedirectRequired?.(data.redirectUrl, data.paymentRecord);
}
```

#### C. Payment Pending
```typescript
if (data.status === 'pending') {
  onPending?.(); // Payment initiated but not completed
}
```

### 3. Redirect Flow
1. User is redirected to Tap's payment gateway
2. User completes 3D Secure authentication
3. User is redirected back to `/payment/success?payment_id=123`
4. Success page checks payment status via `/api/payment/status`
5. Payment status is displayed to user

### 4. Return from Payment Gateway
The existing `/payment/success` page handles:
- Payment status checking via `/api/payment/status`
- Displaying success/failure/pending states
- Redirecting users to appropriate pages (dashboard/wallet)

## Data Storage

### localStorage Keys Used

#### `pendingDirectPayment`
Stores payment details for direct payments:
```typescript
{
  paymentRecord: {...},
  order: {...},
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  orderId: number,
  orderNumber: string,
  amount: number
}
```

#### `directPaymentInProgress_${customerId}`
Stores additional context for customer-specific payments:
```typescript
{
  orderId: number,
  orderNumber: string,
  amount: number,
  paymentRecord: {...},
  timestamp: Date.now()
}
```

## Error Handling

### Card Payment Errors
- Network errors: "Payment system is temporarily unavailable"
- Authentication errors: "Payment authorization failed"
- Declined payments: "Payment was declined. Please check your card details"
- Invalid data: "Invalid payment information. Please check your details"

### Redirect Errors
- Missing redirect URL: Handled gracefully with error message
- Failed redirects: User stays on current page with error message
- Invalid payment data: Error message displayed to user

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Card details are never stored in localStorage
- Only payment record IDs and metadata are stored
- All sensitive data is handled server-side
- Tap tokens are used for secure payment processing

### Authentication
- All API calls require customer authentication
- Payment records are filtered by customer ID
- Redirect URLs are validated server-side

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Immediate Payment Success
- Card payment processed without 3D Secure
- User sees success message immediately
- Order status updated to PAID

### 2. Redirect Required
- Card requires 3D Secure authentication
- User redirected to payment gateway
- User completes authentication
- User redirected back to success page
- Payment status checked and displayed

### 3. Payment Failure
- Card declined or payment fails
- Error message displayed to user
- User can retry payment

### 4. Payment Pending
- Payment initiated but not immediately captured
- User sees pending message
- Payment status checked via webhook

## Integration Points

### API Endpoints Used
- `POST /api/customer/direct-payment` - Process payment
- `GET /api/payment/status` - Check payment status
- `POST /api/payment/tap-webhook` - Handle webhook updates

### Components Used
- `TapCardForm` - Card input and tokenization
- `CardPaymentForm` - Payment processing logic
- `DirectPaymentModal` - Payment method selection
- `PaymentSuccessPage` - Success/failure display

### External Services
- Tap Card SDK - Card tokenization
- Tap Payment Gateway - 3D Secure authentication
- Tap Webhooks - Payment status updates

## Benefits of Updated Implementation

1. **Proper 3D Secure Support**: Handles authentication redirects correctly
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear messaging for each payment state
3. **Data Persistence**: Payment details stored for return flow
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of payment failures
5. **Security**: Secure tokenization and authentication flow
6. **Flexibility**: Supports both immediate and redirect-based payments
